1
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,730
Allah says that permission

2
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,289
has been granted to those who were

3
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:10,649
oppressed to fight and then Allah says

4
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:14,890
that they were driven out of their homes
{alladzina ukhrijuhum min diyarihim}

5
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,539
they were driven out of their homes {bi ghoiri haqqin illa an yaqulu robbunallah}

6
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:24,630
without any right, unjustly except that they say

7
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:30,429
our Lord is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala
and then Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says

8
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:33,509
{wa law la daf'ullahin naasa ba'dhuhum bi ba'dhin}

9
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,750
{ ... }

10
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,830
{ ... }

11
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,050
{ ... }

12
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,679
{ ... }

13
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:48,750
and then Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says

14
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,080
immediately after that about permission
to fight, He explains the wisdom behind

15
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,869
that permission.

16
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,030
He says that the permission

17
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,450
is because : Had it not been that some
people defended other people

18
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,459
in other words strong people defended
weak people

19
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,160
then temples

20
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,470
and synagogues and churches

21
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:17,840
and mosques would be destroyed. That this is the reason

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala gave permission for people to defend other people in order to,

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,470
in other words to defend their religion
because the verse comes down

24
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,130
about religious persecution

25
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,780
religious persecution. That these people were being persecuted for their religion.

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,890
They came to Abdullah ibn 'Umar in Sahih Bukhari

27
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,530
and and they said to him we want to hear
some good news

28
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,640
so a good Hadits {nasma'u minka haditsan hasana}

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,750
and one of them said

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:50,650
Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says: ...and fight
them until there's no fitna

31
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,530
{qaatiluhum hatta la takuna fitnah}

32
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,250
until there's no fitna. And Abdullah ibn 'Umar said,

33
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,940
"Do you know what fitna is? May your
Mother weep over you."

34
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,820
Do you know what fitna is? And then he said,

35
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,810
"Fitna for us, was being forced out of
our religion."

36
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,310
In other words, religious persecution. And
this is why the Prophet was given permission

37
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,250
permission to fight the Musyrikin (idolaters)

38
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,400
to stop them from forcing people to
leave the religion (Islam)

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,780
And he said, "As for what you're doing today,"

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,220
"fighting for political power, fighting for
dominion,"

41
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,080
"this is not what the Qur'an is talking
about." The Prophet SAW said

42
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,880
"If Muslims,"

43
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,330
"together if they meet with their two
swords," in Sahih Bukhari

44
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,870
"if they meet with their two swords, both of
them are in the Hellfire."

45
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:45,980
People during fitna are not called
syuhada' (martyrs). You don't call people that

46
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,040
You don't call people who die in fitna syuhada' (martyrs). This is
according to the Muslims

47
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,320
the Fuqaha', the Ulama'

48
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,250
In the hadits in Bukhari { ... }

49
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,350
There will be continued to be a group of my Ummah

50
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,470
that is on the truth until the the end
of time

51
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,450
Imam al Bukhari says, {wa hum ahlul 'ilm}

52
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,250
in the same chapter, they're the people
of knowledge

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,030
Allah says about the people going out

54
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,549
that not everybody should go out there
should be a group that stays home, why

55
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,049
{li yatafaqqahu fid diin}

56
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:25,810
in order to learn the religion. And then
to warn them when they come back

57
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,440
to warn them what this religion is about

58
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,200
why we fight. What's the purpose of the
fighting

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,100
now you have in the Muslim Ummah and I
don't

60
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,540
you know it's not my want

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,570
to talk about politics in the in
the (khutbah) Jum'ah

62
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:47,290
because the Prophet SAW, I looked
at all

63
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,230
the khutbahs that were available
collected in a book and I in finding a

64
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,140
hotel where he talked about the
political problems at his time

65
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,160
all it was about rectifying the hearts

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,970
about having to quell about getting
close to a lot that's when he talked

67
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,360
about

68
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,210
but he also had time with other people
and now we're in a time of great

69
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,020
confusion

70
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:10,350
there's confusion we have people in this
country going

71
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,480

people going

344
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,009

Roman Cucina

345
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:41,470

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,669
her they've %uh said the Prophet got up
in a hot but

347
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,320

single fit that would happen until the

348
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,200
end of time

349
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,389
he described the leaders he told us
their names he told us what would happen

350
00:21:54,389 --> 00:21:57,490
and he said some others could remember
and other us couldn't

351
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,740
every single fitna so don't think these

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,470
with the long hair cuz

367
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,570
it's not that the problem lies in didn't
have long hair but it's no longer

368
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,310
fashionable in the Arab world

369
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:01,420

370
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,260

that's the nature there's another

374
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,720
troubling had that the proposal i said
im said such a cool fits attuned to show

375
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,170
them

376
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,250

in Dera and then he said

379
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:34,890
that it'll just be after that one-fifth

at one has yet to turn it into a

381
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:41,770
every time the calm down in one place it
starts up somewhere else in this

382
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:47,540
either how was it the riot the suit if
you see the black flags

383
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:51,110
they know what I have it's not it begins
with a fit in a

384
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:54,890
what was upheld by Lana and

385
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,080
and and the midst of it is delusion miss
guidance

386
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:03,130
error what he had a call from

387
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,100
and ends with atheism this was gonna
happen people

388
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,740
people start losing their faith what
happened to the europeans they had world

389
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,020
war 1&2 was enough for them they don't
believe in God in with a word

390
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,470
profoundly religious civilization with
all the churches they built people get

391
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:20,070
people can take it that so much

392
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,650
where's got the question is not where is
God is where are we

393
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,290
that's the question laser on the other
hand he's not as about what he did but

394
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,740
we're going to ask about what we did

395
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:35,920
why are we following the guidelines that
the Prophet a lot incident

396
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:39,070
and in this howdy that mike foale
relates

397
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,310
this is Maddie what he'd done it at that
cuz they

398
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:46,160
most of these they thought had to do
with the Abbasid but then he said share

399
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,490
your own party they split my own a

400
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:52,980
well best known he have a cell at and
they put black clothes on them

401
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,810
and that's only other not may God put
clothes a fire on them

402
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,840
these people are how outage

403
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,890
they're killing moslems that they
they've

404
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,230
every single criteria and don't be
fooled by their piety

405
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:10,270
don't be fooled by their piety cuz the
province allied isms

406
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,210
soda and also out to him to you're also
a time when you see them pray

407
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,900
you'll consider your prayer
insignificant when the CM him

408
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,460
that people want to see amacom but he
said

00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,950
yep crawler koran well let the dollar
hand ideal

410
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,870
they'll recite the Koran it won't go
past that brought the Roma said I mean

411
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,090
they won't understand it

412
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,240
they don't because they don't have the
tools you can understand the koran

413
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,300
without the tools

414
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:40,300
they won't understand and many said %um
upon a minute then so have a hottie

415
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,990
yarmulke limited income a young man who
puts out more memorabilia

416
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:47,490
they will leave this religion like it a
row

417
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,330
shot out of a bowl and

418
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:56,050
an injury why in a Bihari it says yeah

419
00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:01,310
crucial CEO Matti and then the row he
says Mark column in her

420
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:05,440
there will come out amongst my Oma and
he didn't say from it

421
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,370
because they're not from him these
people are not from the Prophet SAW II

422
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,150
sent they have nothing to do

423
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,660
with the man who was sent as a mercy for
all the world and the fact that they're

424
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,700
in any way shape

425
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,460
or form associated with this religion is
a great tragedy

426
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,140
most homes in this country have a big
responsibility to get out there

427
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,780
educate people because these people are
watching these newscast and maybe there

428
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,490
is some

429
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,610
other agencies about I don't know

430
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,920
because this this the age if it's in Sol
confusion

431
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,840
so the problems lie some said but as far
as i'm concerned. I'm not confused

432
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,070
I'm not confuse

433
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,470
if you're confused and study this
religion

434
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,880
and if you think this has

435
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,300
anything to do with the truth you
definitely haven't studied this religion

436
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:55,590
because these people are sheltering

437
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,880
is plain and some and an undeniably
there's

438
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,760
a these a but yet you the sacrificial
lambs

439
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,300
like this 18-year-old boy who left three
Al

440
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,140
who's been brainwashed to think that
this religions about hating other people

441
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,630
you know because unfortunately have
certain

442
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:18,980
sects in Islam now that teach that all
cool far are bad

443
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,590
even on the peron clearly states that
among them are good people

444
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,180
amongst them were trustworthy people

445
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:31,300
ron is a nuance book it's not a
simplistic book is not a black-and-white

446
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,050
world

447
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,250

three inmates minute hi

448
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:40,620
front cover comes demand from the man
comes call for that were fluid by nature

449
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,760
humans are fluid

450
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,910
people are in one state one day there in
another state the next day

451
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:48,870
Buffalo

452
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:55,870
locally helpful

453
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:58,490
handle assault Wilson wanna see them

454
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,260
lani Wilson unfortunately there's not
many

455
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,200
a scholars left in our own a there
really isn't

456
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,250
but the few that are left they all agree
they all say the same things that

457
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,120
whether they were

458
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,760
trained in in Afghanistan or Mauritania

459
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,240
or Malaysia or Egypt or iraq

460
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,380
if they were trade in the senate
tradition they all say the same thing

461
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,650
they don't disagree the others amazing
thing about this religion but

462
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,920
the sex outside they disagree they have
different opinions

463
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,590
and that doesn't mean that the scholars
don't differ among them but about

464
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,530
certain things

465
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,950
they're they're in agreement about and
one of them

466
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:44,260
is that fitna is worse than

467
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,740
then killing fitness were thinkin koran

468
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,040
and fit in a a couple min a party

469
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,820
civil strife is worse than killing
itself just the fact that humans are

470
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:59,670
filled with strike because she about us
that's what he wants to reduce us

471
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:03,550
he wants to prove that that the Angels

472
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:07,140
in their question to God are you gonna
place in the earth

473
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,650
those who corrupt and shed blood doesn't
shed blood that's what they ask is it

474
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,930
that this what they can do the profit so
i said im said you have wiggle room with

475
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:16,600
your Lord

476
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,880
as long as you don't shed blood the
Koran says if you kill a believer

477
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,120
with her and made a judges I hope your
your your reward is Dan

478
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,830
that's faster or killing a believer

479
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,890
and and

480
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:37,700

00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:45,740
because they only one opinion my opinion
one religion my religion

500
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,000
what I say is the only way to understand
this religion so

501
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,040
work at work we're gonna have to do with
this year because it all started up

502
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,520
again

503
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,390
is all started up again and

504
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,510
don't think you can be comfortable in
your homes really I'm telling you

505
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:04,620
I'm telling do not think that you can be
comfortable in your home

506
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,280
because we're we're in a very precarious
situation the first with these mosques

507
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,890
thank God we've got some social order
here so shorter breaks down

508
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:17,059
people get fed up you know the Arab say

509
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,480
watch out for a the Haleem if he gets
angry

510
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,730
people that don't get angry quickly when
they get angry

511
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:28,710
watch out and now it's starting over
again

512
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,830
there they're gonna start bombing in
again most invariably

513
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:35,070
innocent Muslims were killed in the sink
and it just keeps this cycle the

514
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,929
violence going

515
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:39,650
doesn't stop because these people have
they don't know what to do all they know

516
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,419
is to kill

517
00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:44,520
that's all they're just like these group
over here that's all they know in the

518
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,370
how deep they say their showers omit

519
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,850
omits kill kill that's all they know

520
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,900
so you know we have to do with it but
muslims

521
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,230
we need to wake up we need to have the C
group we need

522
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,450
people need to support the the group
that are out there

523
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,740
empower them they need to be doing more
work

524
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:06,799
I mean I'm doing is 10 years I feel like
I

525
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,580
you know I I just think I would all
those places all those talks all those

526
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,700
things and it's just

527
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,780
we're back to square one were actually
worth as far as I can tell

528
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,830
this is worse than before 9/11 even my
father who know

529
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:22,090
just mom I went on to some for thirty
years his psych is this

530
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:27,590
Islam you know that cutting off heads I
guess it's in the koran

531
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,570
so back to square one thirty years a

532
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:37,010
dour you know

533
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:40,220
the few I think they're gonna have an
excuse on your cam all these people

534
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:44,960
as a core demand as I what's our excuse
promise i said im

535
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,179
you know he said that the the

536
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:52,019
all the fitnah comes from the who demand
o'mara does work comes from

537
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:55,710
their own a man they don't speak out
they don't

538
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,940
or they or they sell their Dean right

539
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,889
and then the Omaha that you know but
then also these these political

540
00:33:04,889 --> 00:33:08,139
these people that turned responding to a
political ideology get power

541
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:12,190
you have to blame them as well we're
going to start the blame game

542
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,799
long list but in the end we

543
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:19,580
we have to say that well known for sana

544
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,750
men entered havana I

545
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:27,149
what I've read in a that have not been a
conundrum in a constant you don't have

546
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:29,429
mercy on us for give up we're gonna be
from the losers

547
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:33,000
so this in the end we have to call a lot
in fact

548
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,450
the fitnah in in the hadeeth the
proposal i said im said

549
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,799
that the only one that we say from that
is the one that makes the diana

550
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,250
other a drowning man you have to make
the two-hour

551
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,610
a meant that do at a hundred the battery

552
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:52,389
the one that makes land you mean her in
a min dad do adequate body

553
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:57,799
the they won't have salvation and as you
make the dough out a drowning man

554
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,490
in in the ocean so this is what we're up
against

555
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,159
but not I i feel compelled to talk about
this

556
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,909
I feel compelled to you know we have
some young people that

557
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,099
think somehow this has anything to do
with Islam

558
00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:15,339
you need to educate these young people

559
00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:18,820
yeah young people filled with zeal they
want to do something

560
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,140
and

561
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,460
and they're fed up with seeing
palestinians sacred

562
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,120
muslims massacred nobody cares they
don't care here

563
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,600
they talked the talk about the
Christians in Iraq what about all the

564
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,270
Muslims

565
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:33,570
for more motions have suffered at the
hands these people that

566
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,290
than Chris they will talk about the most
Muslim the we don't mean anything

567
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:41,430
and that's that's the other half the
equation is that they

568
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:45,100
they see that there's no mercy in the
hearts up these people

569
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,270
so they feel compelled to show no mercy

570
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,330
but does not our religion does another
religion

571
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:55,120
that's not our religion our profits I
sent did not

572
00:34:55,120 --> 00:35:00,070
a he lay later to see if the same he
didn't repel

573
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:03,980
a wrong with another wrong that can but
has an A

574
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,840
and he said follow up a bad thing with a
good thing temple her

575
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,880
and it will obliterate it that's does
his religion

576
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:15,690
but does a hard religion is a lot easier
to get angry

577
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,900
lot more difficult to to do that along
offered an hour
